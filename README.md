# The Simple Shell

**Written by Johanne ESSIERE and Seth NAMARA**

## What is the Shell?
A *Shell* provides you with an interface to the Unix system. It gathers input from you and executes programs based on that input. When a program finishes executing, it displays that program's output.

*Shell* is an environment in which we can run our commands, programs, and *shell* scripts. There are different flavors of a shell, just as there are different flavors of operating systems. Each flavor of shell has its own set of recognized commands and functions.

## Shell Prompt
The prompt, $, which is called the command prompt, is issued by the shell. While the prompt is displayed, you can type a command.

Shell reads your input after you press Enter. It determines the command you want executed by looking at the first word of your input. A word is an unbroken set of characters. Spaces and tabs separate words.

Following is a simple example of the echo command, which displays text to the terminal. Try the command:

	echo Hello, Johanne

then press enter. You should see the text Hello, Johanne printed back to you.
